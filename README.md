# What is the difference between tree and graph?

A **tree** is a special type of graph that is connected and acyclic, meaning that there are no
cycles in the graph.<br>
In a tree , there is a unique path between any two vertices, and there is a single vertex called the root that is used as starting point for traversing the tree.<br>
Tree can be usd to model hierarchical relationships, such as the structure of a file system or thr organisation of a company<br>

A **graph** is collection of vertices also known as nodes and edges that connect these vertices.<br>
Each edge represents a relationship between two vertices.Graphs can be directed or undirected, meaning that edges have a specifc direction or they don not .<br>
A directed graph is also known as a digraph.Graphs can also have weighted edges, where the each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.<br>

**_In summary, the main difference between a tree and a graph is that a tree is connected and acyclic while a graph can have cycles and may not necessarily be connected_**
